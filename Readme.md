Learning
========

This REPO stores all the tutorials and documents i've written for java. Specifically, this is stuff that i learned
and taught myself, and found useful during my Comp285 class at WIT.

It's organized so that ```docs/``` contains markdown documents explaining each tutorial, as well as explaining some key
concepts. ```src/``` contains packages that are the tutorials, and even some useful slick classes i've written, which might
help out people who are trying to design games using the slick2d+lwjgl engine. ```lib/``` contains all the librarys and binaries
you might need to compile and run the tutorials. ```jars/``` contains my compiled "librarys" (if you will), that you can reference, to use them.
